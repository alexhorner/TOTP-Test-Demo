# TOTP Test Demo
##### OTPHP based TOTP demo

This TOTP demo, written in PHP, is a single-page TOTP demo to show TOTP in action. It's compatible with Google Authenticator too!

I wrote this to test the following:
 - How well I remembered Git/GitHub (Yay! GitHub finally supports 2FA from the command line)
 - My composer setup, as this is the first time I've used Composer
 - My .gitignore setup, as I don't really use it and needed to ignore the `vendor` directory for Composer
